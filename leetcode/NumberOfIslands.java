/*
This is a variation of the standard problem: “Counting the number of connected components in an undirected graph”.
To solve the SCC problem - Can use both DFS and BFS
Time Complexity of SCC - O(V+E) - Same as DFS algorithm 

Algorithm 1: Use DFS
Traverse each cell in the grid.
If it's a 1 (an island). 
  Do DFS to mark all adjacent islands
  Increase the counter by 1.

Time Complexity - Same as DFS - O(MN + 4*MN) = O(Vertices + Edges) = O(MN)
Space Complexity - O(1) //No Extra space used
However modifying the original input which is not recommended. 
Alternative is to use a visited boolean 2D array

Algorithm 2: Use Union Find
